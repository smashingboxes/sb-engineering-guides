# SB Engineering Guides
The SB Engineering Guides provide a way to document processes and best practices that have established themselves over time or resulted from spikes and meetings.

Rather than just capturing how we do things at SB, this repo shall also document why we do it that way in the form of discussions inside a pull request.

The following table should help you decide if something should go in a guide or not:

| Do                                                 | Don't                                                         |
| ---------------------------------------------------| ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Internal processes (onboarding, PR's, Jira issues) | Things that can be automated (e.g. by a linter and formatter) |
| Link to external guides (e.g. AirBnB Style Guide)  | Write guides based on personal style / preferences            |
| Link to external docs and tutorials                | Write everything by hand and not keep it up-to-date           |
| Core tech stack (tools, frameworks, libraries)     | Exotic / unmaintained libraries                               | 

If there is something missing or out-of-date in the guides, feel free to create a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/smashingboxes/sb-engineering-guides/issues) or a pull request (see [CONTRIBUTING.md](./frontend.md)).
